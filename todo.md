Here are [some](https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar.github.io/blob/master/todo.md) research project ideas, engineering ideas for new participants, and areas where domain experts from other fields might add a lot of value by bringing their perspective into the Mechanical Tsar discussion.

* **Pricing Algorithms**
  * Microtasks are often involve micropayments. Currently, Mechanical Tsar lacks the ability to estimate optimal task degree and price.

* **More Processors**
  * Mechanical Tsar offers a convenient API for implementing worker rankers, [task allocators](https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar/wiki/Writing-a-Task-Allocator) and answer aggregators. The more processors we have, the more flexible we are.

* **Groovy Testing**
  * Rewrite the unit tests in [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) for making them shorter and better readable.

* **Switch to basepom**
  * Our [POM](https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar/blob/develop/pom.xml) seems to be too redundant, so it seems to be reasonable to use [basepom](https://github.com/basepom/basepom) `minimal` or `foundation` settings as the parent POM.
