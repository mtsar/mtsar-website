Here are some research project ideas, engineering ideas for new participants, and areas where domain experts from other fields might add a lot of value by bringing their perspective into the Mechanical Tsar discussion. *This page is inspired by the page [HadoopResearchProjects](https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HadoopResearchProjects) on the Hadoop Wiki.*

* **More Worker Rankers**
  * Implement worker ranking algorithms.

* **More Task Allocator**
  * Implement [task allocation](https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar/wiki/Writing-a-Task-Allocator) algorithms.

* **More Answer Aggregators**
  * Implement answer aggregation algorithms.

* **Better Unit Testing**
  * At the present moment, only small portion of the engine source code has been provided with unit tests. We need more.
