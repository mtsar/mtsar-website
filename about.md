[RUSSE](http://russe.nlpub.ru/), the first international workshop on Russian semantic similarity evaluation conducted in 2014&ndash;2015, needed a human judgement dataset. In order to collect such judgements, a couple of scripts have been written in [PHP](https://github.com/nlpub/russe/tree/56ee058b7a503196e316f03510169427c078e509/annotate) and [SQL](https://github.com/nlpub/russe/blob/56ee058b7a503196e316f03510169427c078e509/russe.sql).

In 2015, it has become necessary to use the similar approach for data collection, but for quite a different domain. In order to satisfy such requirements, Mechanical Tsar, an open source crowdsourcing labor for mechanized labor, has been written in Java.
