Today, [Ilya Sukhopluev](https://github.com/Suhoy95) completed the integration between [Boyarin](https://github.com/mtsar/boyarin), a Web interface for Mechanical Tsar, and [Piwik](https://piwik.org/), an open source Web analytics system. Now it is possible to track the user activity on Piwik. This can facilitate the user experience studies in crowdsourcing by detecting behaviour patterns.

Thank you, Ilya, for this!
