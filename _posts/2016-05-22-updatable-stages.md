Today the pull request [#1](https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar/pull/1) committed by [George Agapov](https://github.com/georgeee) has been accepted. Since then, Mechanical Tsar does not need to be restarted for fetching the stage parameters from the database, they are now updating dynamically. Also, this code introduces a nice feature for both creating new stages and modifying the existent ones instantly. This will indeed improve the overall user experience.

Thank you, George, for such a significant contribution!
