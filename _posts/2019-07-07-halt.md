Recently, I have got a job position at a company that has a very similar offering to Mechanical Tsar. In order to prevent the potential conflict of interest, I have to halt the Mechanical Tsar project for indefinite term.

Anyone who wants to use it or maintain it, please let me know via GitHub: <https://github.com/mtsar/mtsar/issues>.

Thank you!
