One of the many challenges that the [Yet Another RussNet](https://russianword.net/en/) project is trying to manage is the creation of new synsets, i.e. the sets of synonyms representing a single concept.

In order to create new synsets from scratch without shocking the volunteers with [complex](https://nlpub.ru/File:YarnEditor4.png) user interfaces, the lexical subsitution approach ([Biemann, 2013](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-012-9180-5)) has been adopted and implemented as a mobile application.

Technically, this application is nothing but a [Mechanical Tsar](/) client that fetches tasks from the remote server and pushes back the answers. Suggestions and contributions are very welcome.

Interestingly, the application is implemented in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with [Anko](https://github.com/Kotlin/anko). Please note that it does require careful testing at the present moment.
