> The more money we have, the richer we are.

I am excited to announce that we have successfully secured two year funding from the [Russian Foundation for Basic Research](http://www.rfbr.ru/rffi/eng), project №&nbsp;16-37-00354 “<abbr title="Методы автоматизации процесса коллективного построения лингвистических ресурсов">Adaptive Crowdsourcing Methods for Linguistic Resources</abbr>”.

During this project, we will emphasize on improving the quality of the [Yet Another RussNet](https://russianword.net/en/) thesaurus, which definitely deserves some attention. Mechanical Tsar will be used as the crowdsourcing engine for driving up the whole annotation process. This should be of great interest!
