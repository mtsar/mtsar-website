I am happy to announce that Mechanical Tsar has just got his own logo. Just look at him!

<div class="align-center">
  <img src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/mtsar/mtsar.github.io/master/media/logo.png" alt="Mechanical Tsar" style="height: 20em">
</div>

Also, if you use Telegram, consider adding our stickers: <https://telegram.me/addstickers/MTsar> (we've got some memes for you).

A special thank you goes to the [Logomachine](http://logomachine.ru/) team.
