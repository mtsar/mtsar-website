**Teleboyarin** is an open source instant messaging bot designed for crowd annotation via Telegram.

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a cross-platform instant messaging system that provides a convenient [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) for building chatbots, which interact with a user or with a group of users. The API provides additional methods for augmenting communication, e.g. rich text formatting, input completion, command lists, etc.

The three-tier architecture of [Mechanical Tsar](/) requires annotation bot to implement the *application* layer, i.e. it should identify users, provide them with tasks, receive answers from them and deliver the corresponding data from and to the engine over its API. Since all the Telegram users get a unique user identifier (ID) verified by a cell phone number, it is sufficient to represent the users with the above mentioned IDs in order to eliminate the identification problem.
